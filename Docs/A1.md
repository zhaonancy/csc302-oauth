# Functionality
Our application will implement a basic version of OAuth. The basic flow of our application is as follows:
![architecture](./flow.svg)
## Features we plan to implement
- Our sample third party website (the client)
    - Very simple “hello world” site
    - Will have an unauthenticated page with a “sign in with <Dissidents auth service> button”
    - When sign in button is clicked, the third party site will send users to our auth app
    - Once users return from our auth app, the third party app should display the authentication-protected page to the user
        - The third party site should also verify that the returned token is legitimate (by contacting the auth server?)
- Our auth app (the server)
    - Our auth app should receive a request to authenticate
    - Our app should then authenticate the user with a username and password
    - Our app will need a basic database to store user credentials
    - Our app should then generate some token or identifier to represent the fact that the user has been authenticated successfully
    - Our app will also need to be able to store this temporary token in a database
    - Our app should then return the authentication token to the third party site

# Timeline
We will split this project into the following four deliverable milestones:

- Milestone 1:
    - Set up repository and add install/run instructions
    - Ensure that all group members can install and run
    - Set up demo environment
    - Set up barebones client and server
- Milestone 2:
    - Client has the ability to make an authorization request
    - Server has the ability to grant an authorization request without actually requiring any authentication to be done (i.e. hardcoded to grant all incoming auth requests)
- Milestone 3:
    - Server can grant an authorization request only if the user is properly authenticated (i.e. logged in successfully)
    - Server will then generate an authorization token and send it to the client
- Milestone 4:
    - Client can validate the access token to prevent mitm attacks, csrf, etc
    - Client can send the access token to the desired resource server, which then displays the sample webpage

# Design decisions
- Server (auth app)
    - Requirements
        - An HTTP server to receive and respond to requests from the client
        - A frontend UI (authentication portal) to capture the user’s credentials
        - Some persistent data storage (e.g. a database or document store) to authenticate the user’s credentials
        - For the first milestone, we can mock this by hard coding credentials
    - Options
        - Server-side
            - ExpressJS (JavaScript on Node)
                - Pros
                    - We believe our “JavaScript” project is supposed to be         - written in JS
                    - Express framework has built in features like routing,         - which will be needed
                    - Easy to package via npm
                - Cons
                    - Doesn’t provide a clear opinion on application structure, which can lead to a poorly designed/organized application given that none of us are ExpressJS specialists
            - Python (Flask or other library)
                - Pros
                    - All three of us would prefer working in Python
                - Cons
                    - Will require maintaining different applications in different languages
                    - Fine for our team now, because we all have experience in both Python and JS, but if we were to expand or bring on new team members, they would need to have experience in both languages
                    - Python package/dependency management via pip is clunkier than npm
                    - Also doesn’t provide clear opinion on application structure
                    - Worse for asynchronous applications (citation needed), though this is unlikely to be relevant for our application at this scale
        - Frontend
            - React/some other frontend framework
            - Pros
                - Easier to add more functionality if scope changes
                - Can build much more powerful applications
            - Cons
                - Our frontend is a simple username/password form,  we don’t need a full client-side application
            - Basic HTML page
                - Pros
                    - Simple, easy to create
                - Cons
                -   Not as powerful as a frontend framework
        - Data storage
            - Sqlite
            - File storage
            - Hard coded
    - Decisions
        - Server-side
            - We’ll use Node+ExpressJS for our backend, because we believe that using JS everywhere will make it easier to maintain our application, though both options satisfy our requirements. We don’t believe that any of the limitations of Flask will be relevant at our scale.
        - Frontend
            - We’ll use a basic HTML page because our frontend is only required to capture user credentials, so we don’t need the functionality of a powerful frontend framework
        - Data storage
            - Will evaluate in milestone 3
            Client (sample third party site)
    - Requirements
        - An HTTP server to serve the client web pages
        - A protected page which is capable of redirecting the user unless they have been authenticated with the auth server
    - Options
        - Webpage with no backend (React app or simple HTML/JS page)
            - Client-side JavaScript could read auth token from URL and validate it with the auth server
            - Pros
                - Simpler to develop
                - Less is more!
            - Cons
                - Might be less secure, because frontend code will be responsible for ensuring that the auth token is legitimate
                    - In a real-world scenario/larger application, this would be fine as long as the data shown in the protected area of the application is also loaded from the third party auth server which generated the token
        - Basic backend/frontend app
            - Backend would read the auth token from the URL and validate it with the auth server
            - Backend would then generate a traditional authentication cookie for the browser
            - Pros
                - Much more robust and secure, less susceptible to attacks
            - Cons
                - Takes more time to develop
        - Decision
            - Webpage with no backend, since it is simpler to implement, with the assumption that this only needs to be an example of OAuth and not very robust
        - Hosting
            - One team member has access to some hosted server space, won’t need third party providers

# Summary
We’ve elected to simplify the scope of our project, and the stack used to implement those requirements, in order to meet realistic expectations of what we will be able to accomplish during this course. We will be implementing a very simple version of OAuth, which enables third-party web authentication by redirecting the user from a client application to a third-party authentication service, verifying their credentials with the third-party service, and then returning them to the client application. In order to implement this, we prioritized our stack decisions around keeping our project simple and using technologies with which we were already familiar, keeping in mind the limited scope of the project and simplicity of the end product. We will use a combination of basic web pages, Node+ExpressJS, and a yet to-be-determined storage service for authentication in order to replicate the basic functionality of an OAuth service over the course of several milestones detailed above, which will allow us to deliver easily digestible parcels of functionality on a regular basis.
