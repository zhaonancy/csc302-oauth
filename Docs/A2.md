# CSC302 Assignment 2
Due November 4, 2021 @ 11:59 PM


# A1 Postmortem
In Assignment 1, we completed a significant portion of the planning, decision making, and design of this project, both technically and logistically. We identified the key functionality according to our understanding of basic OAuth functionality, and the reduced scope version that Greg Wilson described in during a breakout session in lecture.

We remain satisfied with the planning decisions we made as a group in Assignment 1, including the distribution of responsibilities and the chosen stack and frameworks; however, we are still too early in development of the product to evaluate the quality of our technical decisions. We felt that our documentation clearly and concisely communicated our process.

After a group discussion about our Assignment 1 grade (80%), our own evaluation is that we addressed all of the requirements, but may not have addressed them in enough detail to warrant a higher grade. For example, we did not address the specific design of the protocol used to exchange tokens between the client site and auth app. Feedback from the course staff indicated that our meeting notes lacked some detail, and the overall structure of our documentation lacked easily-readable prose. To rectify these oversights, we jotted down more of the specifics in our meeting minutes, and we steered clear of too many nested bullet points in our A2 write-up. Moreover, we attempted to better express our thought processes during decision-making instead of just dryly listing the final results.


# Features, Subtasks, and Responsibilities

## Scaffolding the auth app backend (Nancy)
The auth app requires various APIs to handle login: serving the login page, and intaking the username, password, and redirect URL and returning a token; as well as verification: receiving a token and returning whether it is valid or not. The routing connects the client site with the backend logic, so a shared understanding of the routes, HTTP methods, request and response shapes was required between frontend and backend. The APIs also interface with storage of user information and generated tokens, so discussion around storage methods was necessary. The deadline to complete backend tasks was November 2nd, where the team would bring together each of our sub-tasks to discuss and connect the parts.

## Deploy staging site (Jonathan)
In order for our team members to see their components working as part of the whole system, we need a deployment where a user can visit the client site, be redirected to the auth application, and authenticate. This deployment must be publicly accessible, as we anticipate that this will eventually be used by course coordinators to evaluate the system. In order to deliver this task, a server must be configured to serve each component in the repository, using Nginx as per previous team discussion (refer to Assignment 1). Successful completion of this task will provide a publicly accessible version of the system, and it is an early priority with an earlier deadline (October 22nd) than other components.

## Designing and developing the frontends (David)
Both the sample site and the auth app require a frontend in order for a user to test our full OAuth workflow. Specifically, the sample site provides a method to make an authorization request to the auth server, and a mock dashboard that is displayed after the user is authenticated. On the server side, the auth app provides a user interface containing a sign-in form for the user to enter credentials, along with a page that is displayed upon a successful login attempt which redirects the user back to the sample site after a couple of seconds.

Since the frontend and backend are relatively segregated (i.e. tasks are not dependent on each other), the frontend tasks did not have a relatively high priority with respect to the backend tasks. Hence, the deadline to complete all of my frontend tasks was November 2nd, our mutually agreed-upon date where we would integrate all of our subtasks together. 

## Integrating everything into a working product (Team-wide)
Our OAuth system involves several components, all of which must be coordinated in order to connect to one another. Integrating these components will require collaboration between team members to ensure that each component uses the other correctly; for example, the client site must redirect to the correct URL in order to deliver the user to the OAuth application. This task will be shared responsibility between all team members, and will be completed in the days leading up to the Assignment 2 deadline.


# Acceptance Criteria
After discussion with our industry partner, we created the following storyboard to specify acceptance criteria for these features.

Our industry partner agreed with these acceptance criteria for a working OAuth system.


# Milestones and Demonstrating Progress

## Success in this milestone
Success in this milestone is implementing working components and connecting them together, so that a user can successfully use the OAuth system to authenticate. As per our acceptance criteria, this milestone was partially completed; the frontends are functional, and the OAuth server application is partially functional (Milestone 2) but there is still some functionality left to be implemented on the OAuth server application and the components have yet to be connected successfully (Milestone 3).

## Progress overview (Nancy)
Three express routes were developed for the server to handle these requirements, and in the end, be called by the client side. The functionality was built up incrementally, with the verification initially always returning a 200 Status OK, and generateToken() required some discussion of our token format - now it is using a UUID package to return unique tokens. Storing different information, such as the usernames and passwords as well as the generated tokens, was also a point of discussion as we considered local server storage (may not be persistent as the server restarts), a database file, and a text file - ultimately deciding on local server storage for user information as only one test user is used, the text file for tokens for its simplicity to implement at this stage of the project. Currently the text storage is planned for the next milestone. Further information was added to the server README about installation, dependencies, and the routes. Overall, the backend routing task is complete in terms of code and documentation.

## Progress overview (Jonathan)
The deployment task involved creating publicly accessible staging sites for the system, which was partially completed. There is a working deployment for the sample client site ([oauth-client.lib.by](oauth-client.lib.by)), however the auth server ([oauth-server.lib.by](oauth-server.lib.by)) has yet to be successfully deployed. An early goal for this task was to configure automatic deployments to the server from GitHub, however we agreed to use manual deployments for this milestone. This task was an early priority as frequent deployment to the staging site helps developers of individual components see their work interact with the rest of the system, so the deadline for this task was earlier than the other code tasks (October 22), however delays in Jonathan’s schedule caused this task to be delayed, which in turn delayed the integration task.

## Progress overview (David)
The auth app’s frontend, including the login and success pages, were completed on October 20. The colour scheme and styling choices are simplistic, with dark grey as the background colour and green/orange as the accent colours. The sample site (containing the “Login via OAuth” button) was initially created with the same visual theme. However, I realized that third-party sites typically look very different from their OAuth service counterpart. Thus, I modified the theme to have a more colourful, vibrant background and use a modern frosted-glass effect in order to make the visual theme of the third-party site appear significantly different. Due to the redesign of the sample site, its tasks were completed on October 31.

## Progress overview (Team-wide)
Milestone 3 was connecting the client site and auth app together to assemble a working system. This was a collaborative effort between all three of us, and the main challenge was incompatibility between modules. We did not discuss the formalization of naming for certain components of the system, we merely treated the examples written in documents as guidelines. For example, one developer may have implemented a backend route with the path `/signin?redirect=foo`, while the developer linking to that URL from the frontend may have directed users to `/login?url=foo`. This task is a work in progress as we make changes to the system which require collaboration from all components.

## Milestone validation process
The validation process for Milestone 2 was verifying that each component completed its functions correctly, according to the milestones laid out in Assignment 1. Each developer tested their own components manually in order to validate functionality, which may have caused misalignment between developers. For the next milestone, we will plan to cross-validate, so that each developer’s work is validated by another developer in order to better align expectations of functionality.

The validation process for Milestone 3 involves walking through the acceptance criteria storyboard, and confirming that a user is able to complete each of the steps identified. If a user is able to successfully authenticate using the OAuth server application, this milestone was completed successfully. We have not been able to complete this walkthrough of the storyboard, so this milestone has not been completed.

## Scope and stack changes
This is a brief summary of scope/stack changes that were made during this milestone. Extended explanation and rationale for these changes can be found in our meeting notes:

- Added UUID to auth app for token generation
- Opted to use text file to store tokens for now, rather than setting up a database document store

## Overview of milestones
Here is a brief review of the milestones we identified in Assignment 1, with their respective statuses:

- Milestone 1 [COMPLETE]
  - Set up repository and add install/run instructions
  - Set up demo environment  (moved to Milestone 2)
  - Set up barebones client and server
- Milestone 2 [COMPLETE]
  - Set up public demo/staging environment  (moved from Milestone 1)
  - Client has the ability to make an authorization request
  - Server has the ability to grant an authorization request without actually requiring any authentication to be done (i.e. hardcoded to grant all incoming auth requests)
- Milestone 3 [IN PROGRESS]
  - Server can grant an authorization request only if the user is properly authenticated (i.e. logged in successfully)
  - Server will then generate an authorization token and send it to the client
- Milestone 4 [NOT STARTED]
  - Client can validate the access token to prevent mitm attacks, csrf, etc
  - Client can send the access token to the desired resource server, which then displays the sample webpage
