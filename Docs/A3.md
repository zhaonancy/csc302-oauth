# CSC302 Assignment 3
Due December 3, 2021 @ 11:59 PM


## A2 Retrospective
In Assignment 2, our team improved overall compared to Assignment 1, particularly in our write ups for meeting notes and for detailing our features, progress, and decisions. We worked towards more thorough documentation and diagrams, which helped to better communicate our ideas and goals for our project, and to better record the process for each of us to refer back to as our project was built up. Our team also did well in allocating responsibilities, divisioning out the technical tasks such that each member had a sizable portion to work on and we communicated early on which tasks would depend on one another in which order, and which tasks would require more collaboration to connect the pieces.

Our team could have improved more on integrating the parts upon completion of individual tasks, as we were not able to meet a portion of one of our milestones, which was integrating the client website and the backend authentication server. We also discussed, but did not complete, storage for authentication tokens - with earlier discussion we could have potentially completed it earlier, but this task as well as the integration task were instead moved to the next iteration of the project.

Overall, our team did well for Assignment 2, earning a grade of 100%, but in terms of meeting our milestone planning, we could have improved by better scoping out tasks earlier on.

## Acceptance Criteria and Automated Testing
Acceptance criteria for our final product were originally defined in the following flow chart:
![storyboard](./AC-storyboard.svg)
Upon completion of the final milestone, all of these acceptance criteria were met. They can be verified manually by a user clicking through our sample client and server setup on the staging site, or they can be verified by running the test suite that we developed in the final milestone.

This test suite verifies the functionality of the HTTP endpoints of the authentication server, as this was the true deliverable of our project. The sample client site is included in our codebase to demonstrate the functionality of the authentication server, but it is not covered by the test suite, as we consider it to be client functionality of our project rather than part of the implementation itself.

The test suite was implemented using Jest and Supertest, popular JavaScript testing suites, and is defined in `server/test/app.spec.js`. It verifies the following functionality, according to the numbered points in the flow chart:

### Responding to a basic request
This test verifies basic functionality of the server: it fetches a basic test route - which does not perform any operations - and checks that an HTTP 200 OK response was returned.

### Serving the login page (acceptance criterion 2)
This test verifies that the login page is served properly. It loads the /login route and verifies that the server returns an HTTP 200 OK response.

### Rejecting an invalid user (acceptance criterion 2.1)
This test verifies that any combination of invalid username and/or password will reject the login attempt, and notify the user that either their username or password is incorrect. We made this implementation decision early on, at the advice of our client, in accordance with industry standards. Being ambiguous about the existence of a username when the password is invalid is a security aid which prevents malicious users from learning about the existence of a given user.

### Authenticating a valid user, generating and storing a token, and redirecting them to their client site of origin (acceptance criterion 3)
This test supplies valid credentials to the authentication server’s login action page (POST /login), and verifies that the user is authenticated, a token is generated, and the user is redirected to the client site. 

Note that acceptance criterion 3.1 is client site functionality, so this is not part of the test suite. Note that the first acceptance criterion is also part of the client site, so it is not included in these tests. Overall, we feel that our automated tests accurately verify the functionality of the authentication server as defined by our original acceptance criteria. No modifications to these criteria were made after their initial review by our industry partner.


## Final Overview of Features
In short, our goal was to recreate a toy version of OAuth’s authorization protocol in JavaScript. The project consists of two main parts: a demo client and an authorization server (or “auth app” for short). The demo client is a simple website that submits an authorization request to the auth app. On the other hand, the auth app provides a login page to the user that made the authorization request and will grant an access token if they provide valid credentials. Finally, this token is sent back to the client, which is used to allow the user access to previously restricted content. More detailed information regarding backend architecture and API endpoints can be found in `server/README.md`.

There were no features that were not delivered; all planned features were fully implemented by the imposed deadline. Some new features were added along the way, as it was difficult to precisely plan out every task that was required to make the entire project behave as outlined. A complete overview of the milestones defined in A1 is provided below:

### Features implemented from Milestone 1
- Set up a GitHub repository ([github.com/zhaonancy/csc302-oauth/](https://github.com/zhaonancy/csc302-oauth/)) with a barebones client and server
- Listed install and run instructions in the `README.md` file located in the project’s root directory
- Tech stack deployed on [oauth-client.lib.by](https://oauth-client.lib.by) and [oauth-server.lib.by](https://oauth-server.lib.by)

### Features implemented from Milestone 2
- Client can make an authorization request by clicking the “Third-party login via OAuth” button 
- Server displays a login page upon receiving an authorization request from the third-party client
- Server can grant the authorization request via the `oauth-server.lib.by/login` endpoint

### Features implemented from Milestone 3
- Server has a hard-coded set of credentials that it will accept (username: `test-user`, password: `test-password`)
- Server generates a token if valid credentials are provided, then saves it to `server/tokens.txt`
- Server redirects the user back to the client site (dependent upon the parameter in the request URL `redirect=https://oauth-client.lib.by/dashboard.html`), and also sends the generated token to the client

### Features implemented from Milestone 4
- Client can send a GET request containing the token to the `oauth-server.lib.by/verify` endpoint, which will return a status of either `valid` or `invalid`
  - If the token is `valid`, then the sample dashboard page will be displayed
  - If the token is `invalid`, then the user will be redirected to the login page
- Acceptance tests ensure that all backend endpoints function correctly
